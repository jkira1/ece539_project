# Skin Cancer Detection and Classification

## Project Description

This repository contains a collaborative machine learning project focused on classifying skin cancer from images and also checking if they are benign or not.
The project uses pretrained CNN models such as ResNet50 to achieve this goal. The data from kaggle which splits the data to test and train as well as their labels as benign or malignant. Note: The data is large and cannot be directly zipped to github, either download directly from kaggle or use the code from the datasets folder to download to your directory.

## Repository Structure

- **`src/`**: This folder contains the main codebase, including model training, evaluation scripts, and utility functions.  
- **`datasets/`**: All data files (such as `.csv`, `.json`, etc.) used for training/testing models are stored here.  
- **`documentation/`**: Place any research, background information, diagrams, or important references here for team knowledge sharing.
