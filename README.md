# 🧠 TITLE

## 📄 Project Description

This repository contains a collaborative machine learning project focused on [brief one-line description of the problem/domain, e.g., analyzing unusual responses in power electronics or robotics sensor data].  
Our goal is to implement and explore a variety of machine learning models — including neural networks, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), classification, regression, and more — applied to real-world signal/data challenges in digital systems.
